F                                C              Bb
 When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
F                          C                   Bb
 and how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
C                         Bb               F         Bb  F  C  Bb
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all 'round your feet
F                                     C             Bb
and your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
F                               C               Bb
and dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
C                               Bb                 (F       Bb  F  C  Bb repeat x2)     
as we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for 
F                              C                  Bb
and this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you
F                        C              Bb
and from above you how I sank into your soul
C                            Bb      F           Bb  F  C  Bb
into that secret place where no one dares to go 
F                                 C             Bb
and your mom would drink till she was no longer speaking
F                              C                 Bb
and dad would dream of all the different ways to die
C                          Bb               (F    Bb  F  C  Bb    repeat x4)
each on a little more than he could dare to try
