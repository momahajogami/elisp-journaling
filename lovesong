Lovesong by the Cure.

[Verse 1]
Am                G        F        E
 Whenever I'm alone with you  
Am               G         F        E             
 You make me feel like I am home again
Am               G         F        E    
 Whenever I'm alone with you  
Am               G         F        E             
You make me feel like I am whole again
